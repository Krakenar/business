## Vision

In today's world, decentralization is everywhere. In a typical microservice ecosystem, you'll have your business microservices, and a bunch of microservices to handle authentication & (identity), authorization (access control), contents (CMS) for blogs and static contents, e-commerce, messaging (emails & text messages), etc.

This may not be an issue for big enterprises and commercial projects, but for open-source developers and small teams, this can be a blocker and occur big costs.

Krakenar aims at providing open-source developers and small teams a set of centralized, open-source tools to handle non-business requirements, such as authentication, authorization, contents, e-commerce and messaging.

In the future, Logitar may also provide a Cloud, SaaS offering for Krakenar, to finance new features and maintenance costs, allowing larger teams, enterprises and commercial projects to benefit from our tool suite.

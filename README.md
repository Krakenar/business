# üêô Krakenar by Logitar

Krakenar is a tool suite aiming at handling non-business requirements, allowing developers to focus on real, business requirements.

## Vision

Krakenar aims at providing open-source developers, smaller teams and small-budget projects a suite of centralized, free and open-source tools to handle non-business requirements, such as authentication (user identity), authorization (access control), Content Management System (CMS), e-commerce, messaging (emails & text messages)

In the future, Logitar may also provide a Cloud, SaaS offering for Krakenar, securing funds to cover new features and maintenance, allowing larger teams, enterprises and commercial projects to benefit from our tool suite.

## Business Case

In today‚Äôs world, decentralization is everywhere. In a typical microservice ecosystem, you‚Äôll have your business microservices, and a bunch of microservices to handle authentication, authorization, contents (CMS) for blogs and static contents, e-commerce, messaging, etc.

This may not be an issue for big enterprises and commercial projects, but for open-source developers and small teams, this can be a blocker and occur big costs.

Krakenar aims at providing a suite of centralized tools to handle those non-business requirements, allowing developers to focus on real, business requirements, the alternative being a web of microservices to handle those non-business requirements.

From the start, Krakenar will be a free, open-source project, and will not have any revenue. If it becomes a Cloud, SaaS offering, its pricing would have to be competitive with alternatives. It should also be modular, allowing potential customers to pay the right price only for the modules they intend on using.

The free, open-source tools will be developed under the MIT license, providing no warranty and releasing Logitar and its members from all liability. Risks will mainly be security issues and delayed deliverables.

The goal for Krakenar would be to deliver its core features as iterative Production-ready deliverables, at least once per month. The projected date for the first feature-complete version (v1) would be **March 31st, 2026**, a year after the writing of this document. We will try defining most of the use cases and spreading them in the course of the next 12 months to ensure slowly-but-surely constant deliveries.
